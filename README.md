# MATLAB-Programming

I am an electronics undergraduate student and have some experience in MATLAB. I had exposure to MATLAB from my own commitments(a Coursera Specialization) and my college Labs. Some of the lab experiments I did during my undergraduate labs are uploaded to this repository. Later on, I will do the same for the Courera course. 

Expanding on the labs, I had Analog and Digital Communication Lab and Digital Signal Processing(DSP) Lab which used MATLAB and its filter design tools. 

The matlab scripts and outputs that I uploaded till now are from my DSP Lab.
